# RailsProjects

Several projects done while learning Rails

* AuthenticationApp. A website that allows a user to register, pretty simple.

* Private Events. Just like in Eventbrite, there are a lot of features. The user can register and look for a list of events. After that, the user can join or create an event, and then he/she is able to see the details, including things like date and who joined. Users also have a profile, in which they can see past and upcoming events.

* Toy_app. Simple scaffolding app that allows a user to create posts.
